\description{
The \code{filter_select_name()} function filters a data frame for relevant results, based on the scientific name given.
Filtering can be done with scripts by exact or fuzzy match. Or, for a more controlled approach, this function
provides interactive filtering by providing the user with prompts. The interactive method allows the user
to manually determine whether they wish to keep results containing certain scientific names.
}
\details{
This function requires packages dplyr and magrittr.
