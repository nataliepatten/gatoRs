gatoRs (Geographic and Taxonomic Occurrence R-Based Scrubbing) provides users with tools to streamline the downloading and processing biodiversity data.

## Data Downloading 

### Identifying Synonyms
Historically, many names may have been used to refer to your taxa of interest. For example, specimen representing <i>Galax urceolata</i> (Diapensiaceae) can be found under the scientific  name <i>Galax aphylla</i>, despite the latter being invalidated over 50 years ago ([see more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galax)). Since synonyms are common, we designed gatoRs retrieve biodiversity records based on a list of names, however the user must supply the synonym list.   

There are many databases available to compile synonym lists for plant species including:

  - [World Flora Online - WFO Plant List](https://wfoplantlist.org/plant-list)
  - [TROPICOS](https://www.tropicos.org/)
  - [World Checklist of Vascular Plants](https://powo.science.kew.org/)
  - [USDA PLANTS Database](https://plants.usda.gov/home)
  - [International Plant Names Index](https://www.ipni.org/)
  - [World Plants](https://www.worldplants.de/world-plants-complete-list/complete-plant-list)
  
 Many R packages have been developed to access these databases including: 
 
  - [taxize](https://docs.ropensci.org/taxize/)
  - [RTNRS](https://github.com/EnquistLab/RTNRS)
  - [WorldFlora](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WorldFlora/index.html)
  - [Taxonstand](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Taxonstand/index.html)
  - [U.Taxonstand](https://github.com/ecoinfor/U.Taxonstand)
     

### Download with gatoRs
With `gators_download()` you can obtain biodiversity records for your species of interest from both GBIF and iDigBio. This function is innovative in how it searches iDigBio. Unlike `spocc::occ()`, we do not query the iDigBio API using the scientific name field, as this will only return exact matches. Instead, we designed a "pseudo-fuzzy match" to search all fields for partial matches to the supplied scientific names. Additionally, the columns returned have been handpicked to aid in processing records for investigations of species distributions (see more `gators_download()`). 

After you identify synonyms, create a list of all possible names for your species of interest with the first name in the list as the accepted name (ex. `c("Galax urceolata", "Galax aphylla")`). Note, the first name in your list will be used to identify the GBIF species code when `gbif_match = "code"`. 

Example:
```
library(gatoRs)
galaxdf <- gators_download(synonyms.list = c("Galax urceolata", "Galax aphylla"), 
                write.file = TRUE,
                filename = "base_folder/my_file.csv", # Location to save file - must end in .csv
                gbif.match = "fuzzy",
                idigbio.filter = TRUE)
```

## Data Processing    
We downloaded 6885 observations for <i>Galax urceolata</i> in the example above. Of these observations, only those with locality information will be helpful when investigating this species distribution. 

### Identify Records Missing Locality Information
Locality information can be redacted or skewed due to protect threatened taxa, often locality information will be provided upon request or can be identified through georeferencing. We created functions to aid in this process.   

#### Redacted Records
Locality information can be redacted or skewed due to protect threatened taxa; often locality information will be provided to aid research upon request. 

To find data that needs to be manually received by an institution via a permit (or removed from the data set), use `needed_records()`. After receiving the data from herbaria, manually merge the obtained records with your original data set.

Example: 
```
redacted_info <- needed_records(galaxdf)
```

#### Records to Georeference
Some records may be missing latitude and longitude values, however locality information can be used to assign coordinates to the record through georeferencing.

To find data lacking coordinates but containing locality information, use `need_to_georeference()`. You should georeference these records and then manually merge the obtain records with your original data set.

Example: 
```
to_georeference <- need_to_georeference(galaxdf)
```

### Occurrence Data Cleaning  
Here we walk through each cleaning function, however we also created a simple one-step option `full_clean()`, see below.   

#### Resolve Taxon Names
To find data containing scientific names corresponding to your desired species, use `taxa_clean()`. Use your downloaded data from the first step as input, as well as a synonyms list, the accepted name, and the filter option (exact, fuzzy, or interactive).

Example:
```
galaxdf <- taxa_clean(df = galaxdf,  
                      synonyms.list = c("Galax urceolata", "Galax aphylla"), 
                      taxa.filter = "fuzzy", 
                      accepted.name = "Galax urceolata") # creates a new column with accepted name for easy comparison
```

#### Remove Particular Record Bases
Sometimes, certain bases of records may want to be removed from the data set. To do this, we provide `basis_clean()`. 
This function can be used interactively by simply supplying a df, but no basis.list value.If a list of basis is provided, the function will select only records where the basisOfRecord value fuzzy match values in the list provided.

Example:
```
galaxdf <- basis_clean(galaxdf, basis.list = c("Preserved Specimen","Physical specimen"))
```

#### Clean Locality  
##### Basic Locality Clean 
Here we remove any records with missing coordinates, impossible coordinates, coordinates at (0,0), and any that are flagged as skewed. The skewed records can be identified with the `remove_skewed()` function and row value for the 'InformationWitheld' column. We also provide the option to round the provided latitude and longitude values to a specified number of decimal places.   

```
galaxdf <- basic_locality_clean(df = galaxdf,  
                      remove.zero = TRUE, # Records at (0,0) are removed
                      precision = TRUE, # latitude and longitude are rounded 
                      digits = 2, # round to 2 decimal places
                      remove.skewed = TRUE)
```

##### Find and Remove Flagged Points
To find records that may have problematic coordinates, use `process_flagged()`. This function can either automate the process of finding and removing problematic points (`interactive = FALSE`) or allow for manual inspection. The latter will let you manually remove points deemed improper by viewing the points on a graph.

This function utilizes `CoordinateCleaner::clean_coordinates()`. 

Example: 
```
galaxdf <- process_flagged(galaxdf, interactive = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/map1.png", dpi = 200)
```
**Figure 1**: Interactive map that appears when `process_flagged()` is run.    



```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/map2.png", dpi = 200)
```
**Figure 2**: Interactive map that appears after we remove points interactively with `process_flagged()`. Points 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 were removed.

#### Remove Duplicate Records
There can be an overlap of records with GBIF and iDigBio. Hence, duplicate records may be downloaded. To find and remove records with identical event dates and identical coordinates, use `remove_duplicates()`.

Example:
```
galaxdf <- remove_duplicates(galaxdf)
```

#### Spatial Correction
The last processing step is spatial correction. Collection efforts can lead to the clustering of points and filtering can help reduce this clustering. Here we provide functions to reduce the effects of sampling bias using randomization approach and retain only one point per pixel. 

##### Spatial thining 
We thin points by utilizing `spThin::thin()`. 

Example:
```
galaxdf <- thin_points(galaxdf, 
                       distance = 5, 
                       replic)
```

##### One Point Per Pixel 
Maxent will only retain one point per pixel. To make the ecological niche analysis comparable, we will retain only one point per pixel.

Example:
```
galaxdf <- one_point_per_pixel(galaxdf, 
                       resolution = 0.5 # for 30 arc sec raster layers)
```

### Full Clean

Example:
```
galaxdf <- full_clean(df = galaxdf, 
                      synonyms.list = c("Galax urceolata", "Galax aphylla"), 
                      taxa.filter = "fuzzy",
                      accepted.name = "Galax urceolata", remove.zero = TRUE,
                      precision = TRUE, digits = 2, remove.skewed = TRUE,
                      basis.list = c("Preserved Specimen","Physical specimen"),
                      remove.flagged = TRUE, thin.points = TRUE, 
                      distance = 5, reps = 100, 
                      one.point.per.pixel = TRUE, raster = NA, resolution = 0.5)
```
