#' @title Perform final cleaning of data
#'
#' @description
#' The `final_clean()` function performs final cleaning steps, including: removing
#' duplicate data points, checking locality precision, and retaining only one collection point.
#' This function also provides the option to interactively inspect and remove types of basis of record.
#'
#' @details
#' This function requires packages dplyr, magrittr, raster, and dismo.
#'
#' @param df Data frame of occurrence records.
#' @param cluster An option (TRUE/FALSE) to cluster geographically close occurrence records.
#' This option is turned on by default.
#' @param precision An option to round coordinates to the specified number of digits.
#' This option is set to 2 by default. To not use any rounding, choose `precision = NA`.
#' @param recordBasis An option (TRUE/FALSE) to interactively remove types of basis of record.
#' This option is turned on by default.
#' @inheritParams basic_locality_clean
#'
#' @examples
#' data <- final_clean(data, recordBasis = FALSE)
#'
#' @return df is a data frame with the cleaned data.
