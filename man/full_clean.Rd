\usage{
full_clean(
  df,
  synonyms.list,
  taxa.filter = "fuzzy",
  accepted.name = NA,
  remove.zero = TRUE,
  precision = TRUE,
  digits = 2,
  remove.skewed = TRUE,
  basis.list = NA,
  cluster = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame of occurrence records.}

\item{synonyms.list}{A list of synonyms for a species.}

\item{taxa.filter}{The type of filter to be used--either "exact", "fuzzy", or "interactive".}

\item{accepted.name}{The accepted scientific name for the species. If provided, an additional column will be added to the data frame with the accepted name for further manual comparison.}

\item{remove.zero}{Default = TRUE. Indicates that points at (0.00, 0.00) should be removed.}

\item{precision}{Default = TRUE. Indicates that coordinates should be rounded to match the coordinate uncertainty.}

\item{digits}{Default = 2. Indicates digits to round coordinates to when \code{precision = TRUE}.}

\item{remove.skewed}{Default = TRUE. Utilizes the \code{remove_skewed()} function to remove skewed coordinate values.}

\item{basis.list}{A list of basis to keep. If a list is not supplied, this filter will not occur.}

\item{cluster}{Default = TRUE. An option to cluster geographically close occurrence records.}
}
\value{
df is a data frame with the cleaned data.
}
\description{
The \code{full_clean()} function performs automated cleaning steps, including options for: removing
duplicate data points, checking locality precision, removing points with skewed coordinates,
removing plain zero records, removing records based on basis of record, and clustering collection points.
This function also provides the option to interactively inspect and remove types of basis of record.
}
\details{
This function requires packages dplyr, magrittr, raster, and dismo.
}
\examples{
data <- full_clean(data, synonyms.list = c("Galax urceolata", "Galax aphylla"), digits = 3, accepted.name = "Galax urceolata")
data <- full_clean(data, synonyms.list = "Galax urceolata", remove.skewed = FALSE, basis.list = "HUMAN_OBSERVATION", cluster = FALSE)
